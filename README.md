Learning a Visual Tracker from a Single Movie without Annotation

Lingxiao Yang, David Zhang, Lei Zhang

AAAI-2019

### Introduction
This paper focus on the method that off-line pre-trains a robust visual tracker. Based on recently introduced DCFNet [1], this paper iteratively updates the tracker by alternating between target localization and network optimization. Besides, the tracker is learned from a single movie, which could be easily obtained other than collecting thousands of video clips or millions of images.

**The learning network can be directly used in DCFNet software [2].**
